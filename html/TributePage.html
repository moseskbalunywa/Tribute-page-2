        <h2 id="tribute-info">Early Life and Career</h2>
        Neymar, also known as the prince who never became a king, is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers
        of all time, known for his exceptional dribbling, playmaking, and finishing. His majestic playstyle blends
        flair, creativity, and technical brilliance, making him
        one of the most exciting players to watch. He is one of the few players to have scored over 100 goals for three
        different clubs and holds the record as Brazil's all-time top goalscorer. Neymar has shined at Santos,
        Barcelona, and Paris Saint-Germain, winning multiple league titles and the UEFA Champions League. His career has
        been defined by breathtaking skills, decisive goals, and a unique ability to change the course of a game.
        <h2 id="tribute-info">A Journey Through Football's Elite Clubs</h2>
        Neymar began his professional career at Santos, where he quickly rose to stardom with his dazzling dribbles,
        incredible goals, and clutch performances. He led the club to multiple titles, including the Copa
        Libertadores in 2011, solidifying his status as Brazil's next footballing superstar.
        In 2013, he made a high-profile move to Barcelona, forming the legendary attacking trio MSN
        alongside Messi and Suárez. During his time at Barça, Neymar won numerous trophies, including the UEFA
        Champions League (2015) and La Liga, playing a crucial role in the club's historic treble-winning season.
        His performance in the 2017 UCL comeback against PSG remains one of the greatest in football history.
        That same year, Neymar made a record-breaking transfer to Paris Saint-Germain, becoming the world's most
        expensive player. At PSG, he dominated French football, winning multiple Ligue 1 titles and leading the
        club to its first-ever Champions League final in 2020. Despite injuries and controversies, his impact in
        Paris was undeniable, showcasing his unmatched skill and creativity.

        After a brief spell at Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia, Neymar made an emotional return to Santos in 2024,
        where he continues to display his brilliance, aiming to bring success back to the club that launched his career.
        <h2 id="tribute-info">The Making of a Star</h2>
        From a young age, Neymar showed exceptional talent, but it was his relentless training and discipline that
        shaped him into a world-class player. His father, a former footballer, guided him through intense drills,
        sharpening his dribbling, agility, and vision. His time at Santos' academy was filled with hours of ball work,
        technical exercises, and street football, which refined his signature flair.
        Neymar's dedication to his craft is evident in his rigorous training regimens, which include strength
        and conditioning exercises, as well as mental preparation techniques to stay focused under pressure.
        <h2 id="tribute-info">Beyond the Pitch</h2>
        Off the field, Neymar is known for his charisma, love for music, and strong family bonds. He has a close
        relationship with his son, Davi Lucca, and often shares moments with his childhood friends and family. Despite
        the fame, he remains deeply connected to his Brazilian roots, frequently giving back to communities and
        supporting charities.
        <h2 id="tribute-info">The Price of Greatness</h2>
        Behind his success lies immense sacrifice. Neymar left Brazil at 21 to pursue his European dream, facing intense
        pressure and criticism throughout his career. Injuries have been a major challenge, sidelining him in crucial
        moments, but his resilience keeps him going. The weight of expectations, media scrutiny, and constant
        comparisons to Pelé and other legends have shaped his journey, proving that true greatness comes with its own
        battles.
